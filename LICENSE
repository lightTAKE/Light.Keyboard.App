THIS END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR LOGITECH GAMING LED SDK ( “AGREEMENT”) 
IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY (“YOU”)  
AND LOGITECH EUROPE S.A. (“LOGITECH”) FOR USE OF THE LOGITECH GAMING LED SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT KIT, WHICH INCLUDES COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND RELATED MEDIA AND 
DOCUMENTATION (HEREINAFTER “SDK”). BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE USING
THIS SDK, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, 
THEN YOU MUST STOP USING THE SDK AND DESTROY ANY COPIES OF THE SDK IN YOUR POSSESSION OR CONTROL. 

1   License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, 
Logitech grants You a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, 
non-sublicensable, world-wide, revocable license to: 
(i) install and use an unlimited number of copies of the SDK on Your computers 
solely for incorporation of the SDK into Your program or software 
(“Developer Software”) and (ii) to distribute the SDK to an end user solely as 
part of the Developer Software.  No other license under any patent, copyright, 
trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property right is granted to or 
conferred upon You by this Agreement. All other rights are reserved to Logitech. 

2   Restrictions.  When using the SDK, You shall not: 

(a)   reproduce incomplete copies of the SDK; 
(b)   distribute the SDK as a stand-alone product or make the SDK available for 
download via Your website or a third party’s website;  
(c)   modify the SDK or alter any copyright, trademark, or legal notice contained
in the SDK;  
(d)   include the SDK in malicious, deceptive, or unlawful programs or applications; and 
(e)   reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the SDK, 
except and only to the extent that this limitation is expressly prohibited by applicable law. 

3   Feedback.  At Your option, You may provide reasonable feedback to Logitech, 
including but not limited to usability, bug reports and test results, 
with respect to the SDK.  All bug reports, test results and other feedback 
provided to Logitech by You shall be the property of Logitech and may be used by Logitech for any purpose. 

4   Automatic Updates.  Logitech is not obligated to provide technical support or updates 
to You for the SDK provided to You pursuant to this Agreement.  However, Logitech may, 
in its sole discretion, provide further pre-release versions, technical support, 
updates and/or supplements (“Updates”) to You without providing any additional notice 
or receiving any additional consent, in which case such Updates shall be deemed to be 
included in the “SDK” and shall be governed by this Agreement, unless other terms of use 
are provided in writing by Logitech with such Updates.  

5   Ownership. The SDK is licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement.  Logitech retain all right, title, and interest, in and 
to the SDK and all intellectual property rights therein.  The SDK is protected by 
intellectual property laws and international treaties, including U.S. copyright law and 
international copyright treaties.  All rights not expressly granted by Logitech are reserved. 

6   Indemnification.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Logitech and its 
shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Party”)
against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, administrative actions, costs of 
litigation and attorney’s fees as may be incurred in defending any civil, criminal, or 
administrative action brought against the Indemnified Party that may arise or result from 
(i) Your breach or alleged breach of any provision of this EULA; (ii) third party claims 
that the Developer Software incorporated with the SDK infringes or misappropriates intellectual 
property rights of a third party; or  (iii) Your failure to comply with any applicable federal,
state or local law, regulations in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. 

7   Disclaimer of Warranty. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LOGITECH PROVIDE
THE SDK (IF ANY) “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.   LOGITECH EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS 
WITH RESPECT TO THE SDK AND ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INTERFERENCE OR ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT. 
LOGITECH DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE SDK, THAT THE FUNCTIONS 
CONTAINED IN THE SDK WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE 
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. NO LOGITECH 
AGENT, OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATION, EXTENSION, OR ADDITION TO THIS WARRANTY.  
Some jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, do not allow exclusions of implied warranties or limitations 
on applicable statutory rights of consumers, so the above exclusions and limitations do not apply in 
New Jersey and may not apply to You. 

8   Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT WILL LOGITECH OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS OF
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF INFORMATION OR DATA, OR ANY 
OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE SALE OF, 
USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK OR ANY LOGITECH PRODUCT OR SERVICE, EVEN IF LOGITECH HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO CASE SHALL LOGITECH'S TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE 
ACTUAL MONEY PAID FOR THE SDK GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.    The foregoing limitations will apply 
even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, 
do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation
or exclusion may not apply in New Jersey and may not apply to You. The above limitations will not apply 
in case of personal injury where and to the extent that applicable law requires such liability. 

9   SDK Limitations. THE SDK IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN THE OPERATIONS OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT 
NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS, MEDICAL DEVICES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT
IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE SDK COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL 
DAMAGE.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SDK IS NOT CERTIFIED FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR 
THIS PURPOSE. LOGITECH DOES NOT MONITOR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS, AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DISPATCHING 
EMERGENCY SERVICES TO YOUR HOME.

of this Agreement, Your rights to use the Logitech SDK shall automatically terminate and all copies of 
the SDK destroyed. You may also terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of the SDK

paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15 will survive any termination of this Agreement.

or entity, You represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the party or entity for 
which You are downloading the SDK to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You represent that

governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California, 
without regard to or application of its choice of law rules or principles. If You reside outside the U.S.A., 
this Agreement will be exclusively governed by the laws of Switzerland. If any provision of 
this Agreement is found to be invalid, the parties agree nevertheless that the parties’ 
intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain 
in full force and effect.

between You and Logitech and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, with respect to the SDK.
